        <p>I'm a software engineer working for a swiss IT consultant company.</p>
        <p>I like to code, relax, walk, run, lift and spend time with my wife and friends.</p>

        <p>I did several coding projects already. I link to here from a lot of places and I'm aware, that this is a real
          mess here. My own personal playground.</p>
        <p>My interest in the coding world basically relies on things users can interact with, on the back- and also frontend side.
          I love to see the reactions and the feedback. If you have some, I'm always open to any kind of it.</p>
        <p>Coming from the countryside, most of my friends aren't related to IT, so I'm always open to get to know new
          people.</p>
        <p>Feel free to connect if you like. :)</p>
